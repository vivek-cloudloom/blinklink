        <Paragraph>
          Our founders and board of advisors view BlinkLink as the natural
          evolution of the “Attention for Influence” model that is dominated by
          monolithic and centralised social media platforms. They believe that
          the future of Influence will be controlled by the true source of
          attention and engagement, Influencers.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          BlinkLink and its founders are dedicated to realigning these interests
          in favor of the creator-controlled ad economy.{" "}
