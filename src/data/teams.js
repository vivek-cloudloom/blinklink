        Our founders and board of advisors view BlinkLink as the natural
        evolution of the “Attention for Influence” model that is dominated by
        monolithic and centralised social media platforms. They believe that the
        future of Influence will be controlled by the true source of attention
        and engagement, Influencers.
        <br />
        BlinkLink and its founders are dedicated to realigning these interests
        in favor of the creator-controlled ad economy.{" "}
